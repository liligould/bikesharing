## Overview of Analysis
Via Tableau, the purpose of this analysis was to determine bike-share statistics in NYC. Choosing proper visualizations such as line, bar, pie, or mapping charts is essential when presenting statistics. The first chart created shows the most popular checkout time of bikes and was depicted with a line chart. This chart style was also applicable when determining checkout times by gender. The next type of visualization created was a square chart which clearly depicts the busiest times and days of the week based on how dark the color is. It is clear that activity is strongest during the weekday mornings at 8am and evenings at 5pm and 6pm. Saturdays and Sundays also show consistent activity. The same graph type is depicted to show trips by weekdays by gender as well as Usertype: customers vs subscribers. Most popular starting and ending locations were also depicted via a circle chart to show the density of the starting and ending locations.

## Results
7 visualizations were created for the NYC bikeshare analysis.

-	The first slide show the most frequent trip duration is about 5 minutes with 146,752 bikes being used for that amount of time.
-	The next graph shows trip duration based on gender with over 100k males renting bikes for about 5 minutes at a time and about 34k females renting bikes for about 6 minutes at a time.
-	Graph 3 shows that bike activity was strongest during weekday mornings at 8am and evenings at 5pm to 6pm. Saturdays and Sundays show consistent activity throughout the day.
-	Number 4 shows the same pattern as the previous graph but in general males use the service more frequently.
-	Subscribers are more prone to use the bike service than regular customers. Males, again, are the dominant gender using the services.
-	Shows the most popular starting locations
-	Shows the most popular ending locations

## Summary
Based on the previous visualizations, it seems like a good idea to open a bike share service in any densely populated city. As cities tend to have a range of incomes, working classes, and tourists, many different types of people will use a bike share service whether it be for leisure or work. While these visualizations are good I think if we went even further by showing the income based on neighborhoods, as well as show the bike share activity per month, we would get a better idea of profitability and use.
